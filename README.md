## âœ… Problem Areas Covered

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- Identified and highlighted nulls in `Quantity`, `Price_Per_Unit`, and `Total_Amount` using Conditional Formatting.
- Replaced `"null"` text values with actual blanks and filled missing numerical values using the column average.
- Used `TRIM()` to remove extra spaces in the `Product` column.
- Converted all entries in `Customer_Region` to uppercase using the `UPPER()` function.

### 2. **Pivot Table Analysis**
- Created a PivotTable to display total revenue (`Total_Amount`) grouped by `Customer_Region`.
- Identified the region with the highest revenue.
- Applied **Data Bars** to visualize relative performance of each region.

### 3. **Lookup Operations**
- Used `VLOOKUP` to find `Total_Amount` for `Order_ID = 1015`.
- Used `INDEX/MATCH` to retrieve the `Category` for `Order_ID = 1027`.
- Compared both methods:
  - `VLOOKUP` is easier to use but less flexible.
  - `INDEX/MATCH` allows for dynamic lookups in either direction and is more robust.

### 4. **Trend Analysis**
- Created a **Line Chart** to plot `Total_Amount` over `Order_Date`.
- Analyzed the trend:
  - Identified a major spike in early April.
  - No clear seasonal pattern observed across other months.

### 5. **Profit Margin Calculation**
- Added a new column:
  ```excel
  Profit_Margin = Total_Amount - (Quantity Ã— Price_Per_Unit Ã— 0.6)
